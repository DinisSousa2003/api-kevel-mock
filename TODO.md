- TOP PRIORITY: Think of what is needed to update the future states on the most-recent and older attibutes: OLDER needs to know the value on the last state (not the value of the update). MOST-RECENT needs to know the timestamp of the update added the value there (tuple value timestamp).
- Postgres is not persisting (lose the data on reload)
- Time between updates not per client on analysis
- Missing test for all terminus (state + others had not good merge)
- Size for XTDB and Terminus from container (not urgent, probably will have to redo this for all containers)
- Script to read the averages and draw a plot for each database
- Thesis writing
