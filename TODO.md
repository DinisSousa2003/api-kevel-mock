- Time between updates not per client on analysis
- Terminus GET only allows one request at a time - lock on GET (?)
- Missing test for terminus state
- Compose for terminus
- Size for XTDB from container (not urgent, probably will have to redo this for all containers)
- Script to read the averages and draw a plot for each database
- Thesis writing
